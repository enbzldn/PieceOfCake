## Ingredients

Each ingredient includes:
- **Title**: Name of the ingredient (e.g., "Flour").
- **Quantity**: A numeric value (e.g., "0.5", "100").
- **Unit**: Optional unit of measurement (e.g., "g", "cup", "tbsp").

Ingredients are added one by one, but after saving the recipe, they will be sorted in alphabetical order.

If you want to set a different sorting order, add numbers to the ingredient names.  
Ingredients with numbers will be sorted according to the numbering, while ingredients without numbers will appear at the end of the list.

Ingredients can be grouped by recipe components. To do this, write the group name before the ingredient name  
in the following format: "group name: ingredient name". The group name should be placed before each ingredient that belongs to the same group.
